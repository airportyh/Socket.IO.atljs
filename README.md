To run
======

You need

- node.js 1.0+
- npm 1.0+

Install Socket.IO

`sudo` might be needed on some platforms w some setups. 

Run the server

    node server.js
    
Open `client.html` in a web browser. It will prompt for your name. Enter your name. Open the same file in a separate web browser window - it can be the same browser. For this one, enter a different name. Now you can chat between the two windows, or at least, you should. Good luck!
